# Triton Droids Humanoid Robot Simulator

Official repository for **Triton Droids** simulations.

This codebase provides a framework to train, evaluate, and test reinforcement learning (RL) policies using MJX and MuJoCo.

## Installation and Configuration

Please refer to [setup.md] for installation and configuration steps.

## ðŸš€ Features

This simulator codebase provides a platform for:

- **Train**: Learn policies using MJX and Brax PPO.

- **Play**: Test trained policies inside MuJoCo environments.

- **Sim2Sim Transfer**: Transfer policies between simulators to improve robustness. (WIP)

- **Sim2Real Transfer**: Deploy policies to physical robots for real-world control. (Future goal)

## Usage

### 1. Training

Run the following command to start training:

```shell
./scripts/single_train_mjx.sh
```

Parameter Description

- `VIDEO`: Flag to enable/disable video recording during training.

- `VIDEO_LENGTH`: Number of simulation steps (frames) to record per video. Controls how long each video lasts.
- `VIDEO_INTERVAL`:Interval (in training steps or timesteps) between video recordings.

### 2. Play

Coming soon.

### 3. Sim2Sim

Coming soon.

## Future Plans

- **Ros Integration**
- **Isaac Lab**
