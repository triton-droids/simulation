# Simulation Onboarding Tasks

**Welcome to Triton Droids! ðŸŽ‰**

This guide will introduce you to MuJoCo through key fundamentals of robotics and machine learning techniques for robotic systems. Each task is designed to expose you to the physics engine and different aspects of robot behavior. You will gain the skills to effectively use MuJoCo as a simulation platform, while also exploring new approaches and solutions to robotic challenges.

Follow the steps, and donâ€™t hesitate to experiment or ask questions as you go!


## General Tips
- **Get started with the official [MuJoCo tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb) first.**
- USEFUL RESOURCES: [MuJoCo API Reference](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/APIreference/index.html), [MJCF (MuJoCo XML) Reference](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/XMLreference.html)
 
## Learning Objectives
The goal of this guide is to introduce you to **MuJoCo** and **MJX** by constructing and controlling simulated environments. You will learn how machine learning techniques like imitation learning and reinforcement learning translate to robot control, and gain hands-on experience with the relevant technologies and frameworks.

Through these tasks, you should become comfortable navigating and manipulating MuJoCo environments but also understand how to design, train, and deploy learning-based policies.

Let's build the foundation to create a humanoid robot!

**Good luck, and have fun!**

## Getting Started
- To get started read [`setup.md`](docs/setup.md) to set up your environment.
- Then, complete the tasks in order:  
  1. [`task1`](task1/) â†’ Scene Construction
  2. [`task2`](task2/) â†’ Imitation Learning   
  3. [`task3`](task3/) â†’ Reinforcement Learning   
  

  >NOTE: task 0 is there to help you gain a better understanding of xml structure and kinematic tree, but is not necessary to complete the other tasks.
